It is an open collective space for critical thinking, born from a sustained engagement with public discourse until a clear and deep conviction emerged: understanding Alawite communities cannot be reduced to binaries of power or victimhood, loyalty or marginalization. Instead, it requires more sensitive tools, fairer narratives, and more nuanced approaches.\n\nIn the face of prevailing discourses that reduce Alawites either to \"ruling sect\" or to a \"powerless group,\" BAA seeks to reopen this silenced file‚Äînot to justify or condemn, but out of a genuine desire to understand. We dissect the complex relationship between the community and the state; between authority and fear; between identity and forced representation. We do not offer ready-made answers but rather keys, questions, and new frameworks to reshape the Alawite public sphere‚Äîor to find a public space and encourage Alawites to form it.\n\nWe write from the heart of experience and from its margins at the same time. We delve into five intertwined dimensions‚Äîhistory, geography, politics, economy, and culture‚Äîin an attempt to build a knowledge map that restores the human, social, and political depth of Alawite communities, as an ethnic, cultural, and social group, away from flattening or local orientalism.\n\nBAA emerged from the Alawite Project (TAP) and aims to gather Alawite pens and imaginations from all over the world. However, it does not seek to represent anyone. We do not claim to hold the ‚Äúone and only Alawite narrative‚Äù ‚Äî rather, we believe in the necessity of listening to all narratives, even those that contradict one another, with the goal of establishing a medium-range studies unit made up of pens and minds contributing to the collective.\n\nWe write from a position of experience and reflection, not neutrality or exclusion.\nBAA is committed to providing accurate, critical knowledge aligned with the values of fairness and deconstruction‚Äînot to reproduce sectarianism but to resist it.\n\nWe welcome contributions from various disciplines and affiliations, from within and outside Alawite communities, to build a genuine dialogue around questions of belonging, identity, justice, and the state.\n\nBAA is not a sectarian project, yet it does not turn a blind eye to sectarian realities. It is against sectarianism, not against sects; against the political exploitation of identities, not against identities themselves.\n\nWe believe that writing is an act of resistance and that thinking is a responsibility. We aspire to produce content ranging from rigorous analysis to creative texts; from critical essays and short stories to academic research; from visual documentation to field interviews. Our language is multitonous: sharp when necessary, poetic when appropriate, and theoretical when vision demands it.\n\nBAA is a home for difficult questions, fruitful doubt, and the desire to learn from memory and reshape the future.\n\nWe write because we want to understand. \nWe understand because we want not to reproduce tragedy. \nAnd we dream because, however distant and complex the future may seem, a word can change it.","emoji":"ü¶ä","backgroundimage":[],"foregroundimage":[]},"id":"66b73d0b-6b40-4ba0-abac-95daebaf79ae","isHidden":false,"type":"textblock"},{"content":{"title":"Blog of Alawite Academics","showcategories":"true","postsperpage":8,"blogpage":[]},"id":"67c01b8c-80a4-4553-bff3-4dad71496cb7","isHidden":false,"type":"blog"}]
