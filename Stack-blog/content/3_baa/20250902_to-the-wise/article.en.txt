Title: How Syria Was Stolen Again... In the Name of Revolution

----

# Introduction
To the rational minds, to all who believe in a free, civil, united Syria, to all who see it as a homeland not a farm, and a home that accommodates all Syrians without discrimination, exclusion, or tyranny.

# The First Story
My grandmother – may God have mercy on her – used to tell a story that stuck in my heart since childhood. It is told that a man drowning in sins approached a sheikh seeking the path to repentance, but the sheikh mocked him and said: "If life flows into this dry stick, your sins will be forgiven," then planted the stick in the earth and drove him away.

The man left dejected, having lost all hope, until he encountered on his way a young man trying to dig up the grave of a recently deceased girl. The madman said: "If I cannot have you alive, I will have you dead." The man stabbed him to death, believing he had been forever deprived of repentance.

The next day, the sheikh saw the stick had begun to bloom! He realized his mistake and sought out the man. When he learned what had happened, he told him: "I was wrong about you. God is the Forgiving, the Merciful, not us."

This story was the first lesson I learned that justice is not measured by the moods of sheikhs or the interpretations of victors, but by the spirit of God that dwells in people's consciences and hearts.

# The Jolani Shock
When I learned of Ahmed al-Sharaa's entry into the palace with his group, formerly known as "al-Jolani," I asked myself: Who am I to judge him for his past? I gave him a chance, as a Syrian citizen yearning for security and freedom, dreaming of a homeland rising from the rubble.

I watched his words, monitored his projects, and waited for his actions. But what happened over the following months was nothing but replacing one tyrant with another, a distorted version of the system we once rose against, and the greatest betrayal was that all this happened in the name of the majority.

# The Beginning of Deviation
Since December 8th, everything I had opposed began to gather before me as a nightmarish picture of what Syria should not become.

- Starting with the Victory Conference, which excluded revolutionary, civil, and political forces, and appointed a president as a fait accompli without the slightest regard for the general will.
- Then came the National Dialogue Conference which was reduced to six hours, hastily conducted without discussion or real representation, distorting the most important national entitlement and preventing Syrians from a real national dialogue with binding outcomes.

# Nepotism and Power
We witnessed the appointment of brothers, relatives, and friends to sovereign positions, and depriving competencies of any participation in decision-making, simply because they do not belong to a specific environment or do not carry absolute loyalty to one person.

The constitutional declaration that followed concentrated all powers in one hand, without oversight mechanisms or real institutions, in a precedent that brings to mind the era of tyranny that Syrians rose against with their blood.

# Hollow Transitional Justice
The transitional justice we waited for ten years was emptied of its content and marginalized, as if we had not sacrificed thousands of martyrs, detainees, and the disappeared.

The file of surrendered military personnel, for example, is a stark example of betrayal: nine thousand military personnel surrendered themselves after promises of amnesty, only to find themselves behind bars, while their families are still begging today to know their fate. Is this not disguised revenge to please a certain support base?

# Reducing the Majority
When Syria's Sunnis are reduced to the Salafi and jihadist current, and they are presented as the voice of the majority, we face a blatant rape of identity.

- When we are forced to accept one discourse in mosques, topped by preachers of hatred and incitement.
- When moderate voices are excluded from pulpits.
- When media screens are filled with hollow religious slogans.
- When the "internal enemy" becomes anyone who rejects a religious state or opposes the leader's path.

This is an explicit declaration of killing diversity and closing the door of reason.

# Violations
The violations did not stop there, but reached what is more heinous.

- Alawite women were kidnapped, without any condemnation or accountability.
- Instead of opening a transparent and independent investigation, a "Truth Exclusion Committee" was formed.
- Sectarian massacres were wrapped in elastic phrases like "individual cases," while they were organized acts of revenge.

# The New Corruption
We saw the looting of the country's capabilities under shiny names like the "Sovereign Fund," amid suspicious deals starring "Hazem al-Sharaa," who became an icon of new corruption.

# Marginalizing Women
Women were excluded from any actual role and turned into decoration in transitional governments, as happened with "Aisha al-Dibs" who represented the worst examples of political beautification and reflected a reactionary discourse that has nothing to do with women's dignity or rights.

# Marginalizing Camps and Refugees
The camps were given no priority, and the file of refugees and displaced persons returning with dignity was not raised.

Camp residents – who are the majority – were left to slow death.

Rejection of an electricity station project for the poor because it was conditional on involving women in management committees.

# Media Complicity
All this happened amid complete media complicity:

- Falsifying facts in most loyalist media outlets.
- Misleading people with fabricated news.
- A flood of "electronic youth" pages to confiscate any opposing opinion and distort its holders.
- Preventing free discussion and intimidating the opposition in the name of religion, revolution, or "stage entitlements."

# Suppressing Sweida
What happened in Sweida in terms of suppressing the civil movement confirms that those who claim to represent the revolution do not differ much from the regime when it comes to force and survival.

How do we understand beating civilians, arresting activists, and demonizing clear and just demands, except as a continuation of the same approach that the revolution arose to uproot?

# Absence of Democracy
As for the greatest calamity, it is that "your transitional president" has not uttered the word "democracy" since taking office.

This is not a coincidence. This is a conviction. And this conviction is the clearest contempt for the Syrian majority that once dreamed of a just democratic state.

# Defending the Majority
Some ask me: Why do you attack minorities?

But the truth is that I defend the majority, everyone who has been marginalized, excluded, and whose voice has been silenced.

And if you do not see that your voice was stolen, and if you do not feel that your dignity was violated, and if you do not know the difference between a state and a farm, then leave us to try to save what remains and build a dream that resembles Syria, not your prisons.

# Conclusion
And if the massacres reach you, pray that among the majority you insulted and attacked, there remains someone with enough wit to write your name on a sign, or remember you with a prayer.

O God, I have conveyed the message, O God, bear witness.
