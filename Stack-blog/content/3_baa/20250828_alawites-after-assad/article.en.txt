Title: Alawites After Assad: Between Moscow and Damascus… From Representation to Exploitation

----

Text:

*Since the fall of the former Syrian regime, the country has entered a new phase of political and military transformations, which quickly revealed conflicting projects vying to fill the vacuum left by Assad. In the midst of this struggle for influence, the Alawite community has shifted from being a fragmented bloc to a battleground for multiple actors who, without mandate or real representation, attempt to speak in its name and redirect its fate.*

Between Moscow, which announced the founding of the first openly Alawite-oriented party, and the Syrian coast, where Rami Makhlouf launched a vague armed project, all the way to the organized recruitment of Alawite officers and young Syrians to fight in Ukraine, it is clear that the Alawite community is not being represented in these projects as much as it is being exploited. What may appear outwardly as projects of loyalty or separatism are, in essence, new attempts to fragment this community and use it as a bargaining chip in regional negotiations, while the vast majority of its people remain on the margins of decision-making—victims of a double betrayal, by the former regime and by the authorities that (link: https://google.com text: followed it.)

# First: “The Justice and Democracy Party” – An Alawite Front for a Russian Project?

On May 5, 2025, Moscow announced the establishment of the “Justice and Democracy Party,” led by Haidar Jawad Tawfiq al-Assad, a former officer at the Hmeimim airbase and cousin of Bashar al-Assad. He is accused of being among the pilots who relentlessly bombed Idlib during the years of the Syrian revolution, and of being directly responsible for the Khan Sheikhoun massacre. Despite official statements claiming the party has a national character and includes members from diverse sectarian backgrounds, its composition and funding sources suggest otherwise:

- The party’s leadership body is dominated by Alawite officers tied to the former military establishment.

- It enjoys unofficial Russian backing, with efforts underway to legitimize its presence in Syria through negotiations with Damascus.

- It denies links to the former regime or figures such as Rami Makhlouf, though many view it as an attempt to recycle the old military elite under new banners.

Above all, this project does not seem to originate from within the Alawite community itself, but was rather imposed as a political tool to reorganize Russia’s interests in Syria, exploiting stranded former officers in Moscow—exiles from political agency and dignity.

# Second: “Elite Forces” – Rami Makhlouf’s Project Between Ambition and Fraud

On April 27, 2025, Rami Makhlouf, cousin of the deposed president, announced on his Facebook page the creation of the “Elite Forces,” claiming it comprised 150,000 fighters and enjoyed broad popular support in the Syrian coast. He asserted its aim was to “protect the coast” and “restructure the security system” in a new framework, away from the Ba’ath Party and centralized rule, while ensuring “loyalty to Russia.”

But field reports from the coast debunk these claims:

1. No signs of an actual force of this size have appeared.

- Testimonies indicate the project was exploited by former officers and powerbrokers, who presented Makhlouf with fictitious fighter lists and pocketed the funding.

- Funds were used for their escape to the Gulf and Europe, or for private ventures, with no real military activity observed on the ground.

Ultimately, the “Elite Forces” appear to have been nothing more than a publicity bubble or a front for funneling money into corrupt networks tied to remnants of the regime, while the Alawite community remained excluded from any real decision-making.

# Third: Syrian Officers in Russia – From Massacre to the Frontline

In parallel, more than 1,500 mid- and low-ranking Syrian officers relocated to Russia in recent months. At first glance, this seems like an individual choice to join Moscow’s military ventures, but the reality is more complex.

Many of these officers fled only after the horrific massacres committed by Damascus’s authorities against Alawites during the “Black March” of 2025. They escaped seeking safety, only to face two grim options: perish in Syria, or enlist in wars unrelated to them.

- Many signed contracts after applying for asylum in Russia, only to later discover they were contracts to fight alongside the Russian army in Ukraine.

- When asked for testimony, these officers remained silent, fearing retaliation or Russian surveillance.

- This development was preceded by recruitment programs launched in 2022 by senior officers like Suhail al-Hassan, targeting both Alawite and Sunni officers impoverished by Syria’s economic collapse since 2015.

Those who were directly complicit in regime crimes were the first to flee the country after its fall. Those who left later, after the massacres, were mostly among those who had believed in the possibility of building a new life after the regime’s end—before renewed brutality forced them to flee again.

# Fourth: Does Russia Really Support the “Elite Forces”?

Despite Rami Makhlouf’s well-known ties to Russian circles, there is no evidence that the “Elite Forces” project enjoys direct support from Moscow. Instead, Russia has backed more organized militias, such as:

- Division 25 (Tiger Forces)

- Fifth Corps

- Liwa al-Quds (Jerusalem Brigade)

These militias received training, salaries, and deployment to Ukraine under clear programs. The “Elite Forces” project, by contrast, looks more like an opportunistic attempt to recycle corrupt financial and patronage networks under a new label.

# Fifth: Damascus’s Authority and the Project of Fragmenting the Alawites

Alongside Russian-backed ventures, the de facto authorities in Damascus are pursuing a parallel and equally dangerous project: systematically fragmenting the Alawite community and distorting its image. In this context, they have formed a “Committee for Civil Peace” to engage with the people of the Syrian coast, after admitting to what they called “human rights violations” during the Black March of 2025.

Key features of this project include:

- The committee includes figures such as Fadi Saqr, former leader of the National Defense Forces militia and accused of war crimes, including the infamous Tadamon massacre. His appointment is said to be a reward for supporting the military coup that facilitated the regime’s fall, and for coordinating with Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham.

- Khaled al-Ahmad, former Assad adviser and one of the architects of the NDF, was appointed as adviser to al-Sharaa, and now oversees “national reconciliation” in the current regime. He brokers the co-optation of former regime figures in exchange for illicit financial deals.

- Among al-Ahmad’s initiatives was the creation of an “Alawite Islamic Council” in Homs, which immediately disavowed Sheikh Ghazal Ghazal and his council—an overt attempt to fracture Alawite ranks and splinter their religious and political references.

This project does not seek to represent Alawites, but to once again imprison them within old security structures under a new facade.

# Conclusion: Alawites Between Siege and Fragmentation

Today, the Alawite community seems to be reshaped simultaneously from the outside and the inside: from Moscow come parties and generals, from the coast Makhlouf emerges with militias, and from Damascus come imposed reconciliation committees and mechanisms of fragmentation.

The lived reality of Alawites, however, is far more fragile and complex than these projects suggest. Most have endured exclusion and marginalization, and the facts show they opposed Assad just like other Syrians, celebrated his fall, and believed in the possibility of coexistence within a united Syria not dominated by gangs and militias.

As for talk of an “Alawite separatist project,” it is nothing more than a political scarecrow, lacking any real base or mature political vision—born of chaos and massacres, and quickly hijacked for exploitation in projects that represent no one.

What Alawites need today is not guardianship, but a political and religious space that allows them to organize themselves autonomously, free from projects of “wealth for security,” imposed loyalties, and histories rewritten through force and propaganda.
