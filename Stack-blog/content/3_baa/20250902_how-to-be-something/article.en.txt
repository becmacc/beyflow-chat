Title: How to Be Something that Isn’t Something

It is a surprisingly common experience that an Alawite child does not know she is Alawite until her teen years—I didn’t.   
Growing up, my family had no access to Alawi mosques, sheikhs, or books. For a time, that was fine by me. I lived my life as any other Muslim would. My mother would drop me off at the local *masjid* on Thursday evenings, where I would don a borrowed white hijab and stumble through my Quran memorization with the other kids. We prayed *maghreb* together at sunset, and the Imam would let us choose from the candy bucket before we went home.   
But as I grew older, it bothered me how little information I had about being Alawite. I observed how other Muslims would react if I told them I was Alawite. Some would shut down the conversation, scrunch up their noses, or go quiet. ّI was amazed at how the Alawite identity had so few connotations to me, yet so many to others.   
Nearly as soon as I learned the word “Alawite,” I was told to ignore anything written about us online—all of this was probably fake, fundamentalist propaganda, my parents warned. But without the internet, there was no one to answer my questions. I begged my family to teach me about the Alawite culture. What were our holidays? Why did we not cover our hair? Why do some Alawites drink? Do Alawites pray five times a day? And what’s all this about reincarnation?  My family was frustratingly hesitant to answer my questions, and I began to wonder if they knew any more than I did. I knew that if the information block continued, Alawite culture would be lost to the next generation.   
​​What began as frustration with my family’s silence soon evolved into a larger investigation of how and why marginalized communities use secrecy to survive—and how, paradoxically, that secrecy can deepen marginalization. When I was 19, I used a research proposal assignment in a political science class as an excuse to spend my semester studying Alawism, taking advantage of my university’s extensive religious library to pursue this personal vexation.   
At the time I wrote the proposal, most, if not all, of the English-language books I found on Alawism were written by non-Alawites. It is an alienating feeling to learn about oneself through the eyes of a researcher, who looks in from the outside.   
# **Secrecy and Power**   
Having been frustrated by a lack of information available to me about my culture, I took it for granted that increased visibility would be the Alawites’ ticket to liberation. Maybe it is the American in me: I’ve been steeped in the idea that minority groups can become freer, more powerful, and more influential by increasing their representation in the public sphere. That made it all the more difficult to understand the Alawites’ silence. I could only see it as censure.   
But I learned over the course of my research that privacy can be a remarkable tool that marginalized communities use to gain and maintain power in society. I was fascinated to read about other groups that also practiced discreetly as a means of self-protection. From Zoroastrians in Islamized Iran, to Spanish Jews and Muslims during the Reconquista, persecuted minority religious groups often survive by practicing in secret. In Islam, such protective secrecy is called taqiyya (religious dissimulation). In Syria alone, several ethnoreligious communities practice some form of religious dissimulation, including the Alawites and Druze.   
Secrecy does not just protect information—it can shape a community’s relationship to power when they don’t have much of it. I was particularly attracted to an idea espoused by a scholar of secretive religions, Hugh Urban. Urban theorizes that marginalized groups keep certain knowledge hidden from others to hold on to a sense of agency. Concealing knowledge, particularly spiritual knowledge, creates an “us” and “them” between community insiders and outsiders—those who have the knowledge, and those who are not deemed worthy of it.   
I buy the idea that selective access to knowledge is a proxy for power. Even within the Alawite faith, restrictions on who could be initiated and who could not seemed to help our community organize into a hierarchical structure. For example, the taboo against initiating Alawite women seems to ensure they must marry Alawite men, lest their home be bereft of sacred knowledge. Similarly, the age requirement ensures that Alawite youth remain dependent on their elders for spiritual education, guidance, and support.   
But for the Alawites: was our historical silence a net positive? I am still skeptical. Without a positive conception of who the Alawites were, we allowed speculative rumors of—sometimes hostile, sometimes merely uninformed—parties to fill the vacuum. While the Alawite community refused to express who it was to the world, the Alawite identity became necessarily defined in antithesis. We began to understand ourselves not as *something*, but as the *opposite of something else.*   
The limitations of the dissimulative approach are apparent in the current political moment. At the time when the Alawite community is most at risk, most in need of life-saving intervention—no one knows who they are, independent of their association in popular consciousness with Assad and his brutal dictatorship. This limits the effectiveness of our activism. Instead of lobbying for the protection and preservation of our people from genocide, we must spend the first 20 minutes of every congressional meeting asserting who we are, a task which too often ends up being more of an assertion of who we are not. We are, again forced to define ourselves in antithesis. I am humiliated every time I have to explain, sitting across from a congressional representative or their staff, that Alawites are not fundamentalist muslims, not terrorists, not Assad regime remnants, not armed, not dangerous, not wealthy, not, not, not.   
But such limitations were also clear 11 years ago. A hundred years ago, even. There are patterns to the types of discrimination faced by minority dissimulative groups. The relationship between secrecy and marginalization is often cyclical. Persecuted minorities’ dissimulation is often viewed by outsiders as an implication they have something (bad) to hide; these groups are frequently accused of concealing unsavory, blasphemous, or sexually deviant behaviors behind closed doors (see, for example: the case of blood libel against Jews, or accusations of hidden erotic rites against several groups, including early Gnostic Christians). These accusations often become fodder for further violence or social censure. In response, persecuted groups may double down on their original self-isolating behaviors or discreet practices.   
# **A Change in Strategy: Why Context Matters**   
Now, the Alawites are breaking the cycle. In a panicked frenzy, they are creating networks, group chats, and institutions for the dissemination and preservation of their culture and ideas. They are writing books and developing educational materials. They are creating newspapers like this one. But we are doing so only after being backed into a corner. Which begs the question: if and when the current existential threat to Alawite survival subsides, will we maintain this newfound energy and community togetherness?   
	In an evolutionary and developmental psychology seminar last year, I encountered the idea that some cultures are “high-context” and others are “low-context.” Traditional societies are high-context. This means that not everything needs to be expressed verbally in order to be known. Members are deeply attuned to one another’s needs and identities—they attempt to meet one another’s needs as soon as they become aware of them through nonverbal or indirect signals, not as soon as they become explicitly expressed. People became natural experts at observation, rather than experts at extracting verbal information from others.  
By contrast, the Western world is relatively low-context. Things must be expressed clearly, discretely, loudly. If it is not expressed, it is often treated as if it doesn’t exist. A closed mouth doesn’t get fed. We declare everything: independence, love, bankruptcy, foreign chocolate at airport customs.   
	As someone who has written essays for a living (and, as a precursor, been frequently chastised in school for talking too much), I am now convinced that there is a privilege in not having to explain who you are. That in a healthy society, we would be known without having to pull back our curtains for the world to take a look inside.   
	The Alawite community had to do the latter once before, when in 1972, a council of Alawite sheikhs released a fatwa outlining the community’s status as Muslims. The language in the fatwa is unequivocal: the Alawites are Muslims, and any Alawite who denies their Muslim-ness is not an Alawite. Such a strong, public, hardline declaration seems antithetical to the Alawites’ ethos. They rarely make such unified public statements about anything, and focus less on generalized fatwas and more on individual and personalized spirituality. But when Hafez Al-Assad seized power through a military coup, he sought to legitimize his reign and appease the Sunni majority by placing the Alawites within some kind of orthodox Islamic frame. But in the end, the Alawites were neither adopted by mainstream Sunnis nor orthodox Shia.   
Our more recent unveiling is a necessary adaptation to a changing world. Unfortunately, it feels less like progress and more like a forced inspection, yet another humiliation, laying the community bare in front of the world, in exchange for its chance at survival. We are being made to prove our innocence with our necks at the blade of a jihadist’s knife. There is no other option. The community lacks the power to choose how much it reveals or conceals. Yesterday we had to be invisible. Today, we must be PR representatives, building a community and its image simultaneously. A moment which, several years ago, might have felt empowering, freeing, and beautiful, ironically feels like an indicator of defeat, a loss of dignity.   
The idea of protecting dignity by preventing over-disclosure is reflected in many traditional elements of Arab and Ancient Near Eastern cultures. For example, it is why the Bedouins famously do not ask a traveler’s name for three days if one should ask for shelter, in order to preserve his dignity and ensure they provide gracious and unbiased hospitality. Franz Fanon wrote admiringly of veiled women he encountered in Algeria, “The woman who sees without being seen…frustrates the colonizer.” And Michael Barkun, a scholar of religion and violence, wisely notes, “...Just as the sacred may be secret, so the secret can acquire the trappings of sacredness.”   
	In a well-ordered society, elements are innocent until proven guilty. In Syria, minorities face the opposite struggle—if they are not pressured to exonerate themselves politically (i.e. to publicly distance themselves from the previous regime and prove their loyalty to the new one), then they are pressured to exonerate themselves as believers, to prove they are not heretics. 

My intent is not to debate whether silence or exposure constitutes a better approach. Rather, it is a call to keep in mind the locus of control of these decisions, which, up until this point, lies outside of the Alawite community.

Don't ask the trees for their names  
Don't ask the valleys who their mother is.
