In the Dweila neighborhood of Damascus, while worshippers were completing the rituals of Sunday Mass, two young men tried to stop a suicide bomber who wanted blood to be shed in a house of prayer.
Jiries and Butrus Bishara, brothers, did not ask the killer about his sect, nor did they debate his "political project." They simply stood in front of him. They died. Dozens behind them survived.

The scene needed no interpretation. Martyrs. That’s how everyone who heard the story saw them — except one party: **the Syrian Interim Administration**.

The political arm of the opposition, which was supposed to be the "democratic alternative" to the regime of repression, issued a cold statement. No mercy, no prayer. They did not call them martyrs, did not say they "fell to protect the worshippers," but merely described them as "victims" of an incident it did not want to see.
The statement was not linguistically wrong, but it was morally, religiously, and nationally wrong. Because it feared one word: **martyr**.

# **Who Holds the Keys to Martyrdom?**

This is not the first time that **“martyrdom” has become a sectarian privilege**. For decades, under the pressure of rising Salafi rhetoric, the title has been reserved: only a Sunni Muslim, killed according to a specific interpretation of “in the path of God,” could be granted the honor of martyrdom.
Others? No.
Even if they stood with their bodies before death to protect worshippers. Even if they refused to flee in order to prevent disaster. Even if they believed their act was right.

**But who said this understanding is original?**

In the Qur’an, the word “shahid” (martyr) is never used to mean someone killed in battle. *“Do not think of those who are killed in the path of God as dead”* — yes. But they are not called “shuhada.”
The root (ش هـ د) in the Book means **to be present, to speak the truth, to witness with one’s eyes, heart, or tongue**.
The word that became a title for heroic death was not originally so.

# **When the Martyr Was Born… He Was Jewish**

To know where the idea came from, we must return to the 2nd century BCE, to the **Second Temple in Jerusalem**.
During Seleucid persecution, when Jews were forced to eat pork and abandon the Sabbath, an old man named **Eleazar** stood before the soldiers.
He refused. He could have pretended, eaten other meat in front of them, but he didn’t. He said:

*"Even if I escape human punishment now, I will not escape the hand of God, whether in life or in death."*
And he died.
He died to teach the young that dying in truth is nobler than living in falsehood.

After him came the mother and her seven sons. Each one tortured to death, refusing to abandon the Law.

*"The King of the universe will raise us to eternal life, because we died for His law."*

These were the first to carry the title of “martyrs” — not because they were killed, but because they **bore witness to the truth until the end**.

# **Then Christ Was Crucified… And Blood Became Prayer**

In Christianity, the word took a new path. The martyr became known as **Martys** in Greek — meaning: **the witness**.

**Stephen**, the first Christian martyr, was stoned because he said Jesus is alive.
Before he died, he prayed for his killers:

*"Lord, do not hold this sin against them."*

**Ignatius of Antioch** wrote on his way to Rome, where beasts would devour him, that he wished to be ground like wheat to become bread for Christ.
**Polycarp**, an old man, refused to curse Christ, saying:

*"For 86 years I have served Him, and He has done me no wrong. How can I blaspheme my Savior?"*
He was burned alive.

In every story, death was not meaningless, but a living testimony. Not about a text, but about a faith lived as truth.
Here, the martyr is not defined only by religion, but by what he **testifies to, even unto death**.

# **Then Came Islam… Borrowing the Name, Not the Origin**

In early Islam, the term “martyr” was not yet a religious concept. One who died in battle was simply said to be “killed in the path of God.”
But with the expansion of the Umayyad state, and the pressing need to justify conquests and deaths in power struggles, the concept of “martyr” was imported — not from the Qur’an, but from Byzantine Christian culture.
The fighter who died for the state became a martyr. Not because he bore witness, but because he died.
After the Umayyads came the Abbasids, then the Sufis, then the Fatimids, each shaping a meaning of martyrdom to serve their theology and authority.

And the law? It lost its way.

# **Jiries and Butrus: Martyrs Despite You**

Why tell all this now? Because Jiries and Butrus, in their deaths, redefined the word.
They carried no rifles, announced no call to arms. They simply wanted to protect those praying.
They did what Eleazar did, and what Stephen did.
They stood where heroism begins: **at the edge of fear**.

And the irony? The first to refuse to see them as martyrs was not Assad’s regime, but the body that claims to represent the revolution born for dignity and citizenship.

But **martyrdom is not granted by a press release**. It needs no clerical stamp or theological approval.

Whoever dies to protect prayer — no matter its direction — is a martyr in the eyes of God.
Even if sects deny them, fatwas excommunicate them, and politicians keep silent.

**In death, as in life, no religion cancels out humanity.**
**And at the moment of truth, no one asks the name of your God.**
**They ask only: Did you stand, or did you run?**

And Jiries and Butrus… they stood.
