Title: Between Aesthetics and Documentation: Syrian Arts and the Responsibility of Conveying Reality

# **Art and False Satisfaction**

You can surely recall at least one film about a human tragedy — massacres against large groups — that still left you with a smile and a sense of satisfaction.
But is this the art we need in the midst of **ethnic cleansing** against Alawites and ongoing massacres against the Syrian people?

# **Contemporary Art and Expanding Tools**

Beyond the Western classification of seven arts
*(music, painting, sculpture, architecture, dance, literature, cinema)*,
contemporary art has embraced **photography, printing, graphic design, fashion design…**
These are living tools that:

* showcase **plurality** and **individuality**,
* highlight **harmony** within societies and across cultures.

# **Art as Documentation and Memory**

Art is a key factor in **preserving human history**, documenting eras, and influencing both the present and the future.
By nature, art is **free**, creating keys to unlock the chains of **politics**, **social traditions**, and **economics**.

# **Power and Art as Ideology**

Authorities often weaponize art for their own benefit.
The **former Syrian regime** used all forms of art to entrench its power, replacing war’s reality with **images of peace** and **false slogans**, deepening the divide between citizens and their right to the **truth**.

# **A Global Phenomenon of Beautifying Suffering**

This phenomenon is not unique to Syria. Totalitarian regimes worldwide have turned art into propaganda.
*Hollywood cinema* often glorifies **bloodshed** as patriotism, such as *American Sniper (2014)*, which portrays Chris Kyle as a hero while ignoring the suffering of Iraqi civilians.

# **Music and Drama as Normalization Tools**

Such art glorifies war and fuels militant enthusiasm among youth.
Examples include **songs** like *Ya Bashar Metlak Min*, which became wedding and graduation music, and Syrian dramas like *Spot of Light* and *Sah El Nom*, which normalized **corruption** as daily comedy.

# **Tragedy and Shallow Aesthetics**

When **good and evil** are oversimplified, executioners are painted as pure darkness, and victims as absolute innocence.
The moral struggle vanishes, and tragedy becomes mere **emotional spectacle** instead of truth.

# **Syrian Examples**

* *Last Men in Aleppo* celebrated individual heroism but avoided political complexity.
* *Freedom Gravity* by Tammam Azzam and *Love in the Time of War* by Zuhair Hassib turned tragedy into visual appeal.
* In contrast, *Nezouh* (Soudade Kaadan), *Adel Dawood’s* works, and *Khaled Dawwa’s* sculptures portrayed suffering in all its **brutality and chaos**.

# **Social Art as an Alternative**

Today, Syrians are called to support **Social Art**, independent from governments and capital.
This art:

* raises **social and political issues**,
* fosters **participation**,
* creates safe spaces for youth, as in *Citizens.Artists (2012)*.

# **Art as a Space for Awareness and Change**

The goal of social art is not just to express pain, but to **stimulate awareness, dialogue, and change**.
In Syria, it resists authority, reflects the people’s voices, and breaks free from imposed narratives.
As Saadallah Wannous said:
*"Even if the king changes; the only path for the king is terror, and more terror."*
