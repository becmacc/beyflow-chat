# BeyFlow Chat - Visual Workflow Automation Platform

## Overview

BeyFlow Chat has evolved into a visual workflow automation platform where users can connect APIs (ChatGPT, Make.com scenarios), LLMs, agents, and tools together through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Built with React 19 and Vite, it features a cyberpunk-styled Web3 aesthetic with neon colors, glitch effects, and smooth animations.

The platform includes a fully functional visual workflow builder that lets users create automation flows by connecting trigger nodes (ChatGPT, webhooks, schedules), action nodes (Make.com, OpenAI, Gmail, Discord, Twilio), and logic nodes (conditions, delays, filters). The workflow execution engine processes nodes in topological order, makes real API calls to OpenAI (via Replit AI integration) and Make.com webhooks, and displays real-time execution progress with visual node highlighting and detailed logging.

The application features a **theme persona system** allowing users to switch between different UI aesthetics:
- **Terminal Hacker**: Dark cyberpunk with monospace fonts, minimal cyan accents, pure black backgrounds
- **Glassmorphic Modern**: Colorful gradient backgrounds, frosted glass effects, rounded corners, soft shadows

The app emphasizes a dopaminergic, reward-based UI with minimizable panels for performance monitoring and analytics, and a modular architecture ready for Web3 integration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- JSX files treated as JavaScript modules with automatic transformation

**State Management**: Zustand with advanced middleware stack
- Multiple specialized stores (audio, chat, UI) for separation of concerns
- `subscribeWithSelector` middleware for granular subscriptions
- `devtools` middleware for Redux DevTools integration
- `persist` middleware for localStorage synchronization
- `immer` middleware for immutable state updates with mutable syntax
- Legacy store bridge for backward compatibility during migration

**Styling System**: TailwindCSS v3 with cyberpunk/Web3 theme
- Neon color palette: neon-cyan (#00F0FF), neon-magenta (#FF00FF), neon-green (#00FF41)
- Cyberpunk effects: scanlines, glitch effects, tech-focused grid backgrounds
- Custom animations (float, pulse-slow, bounce-slow) for dopaminergic effects
- Glassmorphism design patterns with backdrop blur utilities (cyber-card class)
- Custom scrollbar styling with neon accents
- Google Fonts integration (Inter, Space Grotesk, Orbitron for tech text)

**Animation Framework**: Framer Motion v11
- Smooth page transitions and component animations
- Physics-based spring animations
- Gesture-based interactions
- Exit animations for component unmounting

**3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber ecosystem
- `@react-three/fiber` for declarative Three.js in React
- `@react-three/drei` for helper components and abstractions
- Interactive particle systems with recursive patterns
- Audio-reactive lighting and transformations
- Orbit controls with auto-rotation capabilities

### Workflow Builder Module

**Visual Workflow Canvas**: Drag-and-drop node-based automation designer with real execution
- 15+ pre-configured node types across 3 categories (triggers, actions, logic)
- Drag-and-drop positioning with smooth Framer Motion animations
- Visual connection lines with gradient effects between nodes
- Real-time workflow validation and connection management
- Node palette sidebar with searchable, categorized nodes
- Fully functional execution engine that:
  - Builds topological execution order from node graph
  - Executes nodes sequentially with data flow between nodes
  - Makes real API calls (OpenAI GPT-4, Make.com webhooks)
  - Shows real-time progress with node highlighting during execution
  - Displays detailed execution log with success/error states
  - Returns complete execution results with all node outputs

**Node Categories**:
1. **Triggers**: ChatGPT, Webhook, Schedule, Chat Message
2. **Actions**: Make.com, OpenAI, Gmail, Notion, Google Sheets, Discord, Twilio
3. **Logic**: Condition (if/then/else), Delay, Filter, Transform

**OpenAI Integration**: Via Replit AI Integrations (no API key needed)
- Charges billed directly to Replit credits
- Environment variables auto-configured: `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Exposed to client-side via Vite define config for browser access

### Backend Architecture

**API Integration Pattern**: Webhook-based architecture
- Primary integration with Make.com scenarios via HTTP webhooks
- Default webhook endpoint: `https://hook.eu2.make.com/8n2onkq2qybp58ugij473e7ekvex`
- Centralized API module (`src/modules/api.js`) for all external calls

- Configurable delays to manage system load
- Active sequence tracking with cleanup handlers
- Six pre-configured flows: ChatToGmailSync, VoiceFeedbackLoop, GeminiAssist, BrandAssetReaction, SessionAnalytics, ImageGenerationPrep

**Data Flow Pattern**:
1. User interaction â†’ UI component
2. Component dispatches action to Zustand store
3. Store updates trigger side effects (webhooks, audio, animations)
4. Webhook responses update store state
5. UI reactively renders based on state changes

### Audio System

- Pitch detection algorithms
- Real-time audio feature extraction (frequency, waveform, tempo, key)
- Audio effects chain (reverb, delay, distortion, filters, compression)
- Visualization modes (spectrum, waveform)

### Data Storage

**Browser Storage Strategy**:
- localStorage for persistent user preferences and settings
- sessionStorage for temporary session data
- Zustand persist middleware for automatic state synchronization
- Session management with save/load capabilities
- Chat history persistence across page refreshes

**State Schema**:
```javascript
{
  user: string,
  messages: array<{id, from, msg, time, type}>,
  ui: {theme, gradientShift, sliderValue, patternDepth},
  audio: {playing, volume, isListening, audioUrl},
  sceneConfig: {particleCount, rotation, color},
  analytics: {messageCount, responseTime, sessionStart}
}
```
