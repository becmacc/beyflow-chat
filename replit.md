# BeyFlow Chat - Dopaminergic Web3 Chat Experience

## Overview

BeyFlow Chat is a cutting-edge chat application that combines modern web technologies to create an immersive, dopaminergic user experience. Built with React 19 and Vite, it features 3D visualizations powered by Three.js, advanced audio processing with ElevenLabs TTS and Web Speech API, and a lightweight automation system called "Banana Flow" for background orchestration.

The application emphasizes smooth animations, reward-based UI patterns, and seamless integrations with external services like Make.com webhooks, Gmail, and AI providers (OpenAI, Gemini). It's designed as a modular, extensible platform with hooks for future Web3 integration including wallet connectivity and 3D avatar identity.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Core Framework**: React 19 with Vite as the build tool and development server
- Fast refresh for instant updates during development
- ESBuild for optimized production builds
- JSX files treated as JavaScript modules with automatic transformation

**State Management**: Zustand with advanced middleware stack
- Multiple specialized stores (audio, chat, UI) for separation of concerns
- `subscribeWithSelector` middleware for granular subscriptions
- `devtools` middleware for Redux DevTools integration
- `persist` middleware for localStorage synchronization
- `immer` middleware for immutable state updates with mutable syntax
- Legacy store bridge for backward compatibility during migration

**Styling System**: TailwindCSS v3 with custom dopamine theme
- Custom color palette featuring primary (#4CC3D9), accent, and gradient colors
- Custom animations (float, pulse-slow, bounce-slow) for dopaminergic effects
- Glassmorphism design patterns with backdrop blur utilities
- Custom scrollbar styling with brand colors
- Google Fonts integration (Inter, Space Grotesk)

**Animation Framework**: Framer Motion v11
- Smooth page transitions and component animations
- Physics-based spring animations
- Gesture-based interactions
- Exit animations for component unmounting

**3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber ecosystem
- `@react-three/fiber` for declarative Three.js in React
- `@react-three/drei` for helper components and abstractions
- Interactive particle systems with recursive patterns
- Audio-reactive lighting and transformations
- Orbit controls with auto-rotation capabilities

### Backend Architecture

**API Integration Pattern**: Webhook-based architecture
- Primary integration with Make.com scenarios via HTTP webhooks
- Default webhook endpoint: `https://hook.eu2.make.com/8n2onkq2qybp58ugij473e7ekvex`
- Centralized API module (`src/modules/api.js`) for all external calls
- Response time tracking and analytics built into API layer
- Retry logic and error handling for resilient communication

**Automation System (Banana Flow)**: Lightweight parallel automation engine
- Event-driven architecture with trigger-action mapping
- JSON-based flow configuration (`batch_sequences.json`)
- Priority-based execution (high/medium/low)
- Configurable delays to manage system load
- Active sequence tracking with cleanup handlers
- Six pre-configured flows: ChatToGmailSync, VoiceFeedbackLoop, GeminiAssist, BrandAssetReaction, SessionAnalytics, ImageGenerationPrep

**Data Flow Pattern**:
1. User interaction â†’ UI component
2. Component dispatches action to Zustand store
3. Store updates trigger side effects (webhooks, audio, animations)
4. Webhook responses update store state
5. UI reactively renders based on state changes

### Audio System

**Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API
- Multi-voice support (Rachel, Drew, Clyde)
- Multilingual model with voice settings customization
- Stability, similarity boost, and speaker boost parameters
- Text truncation to 500 characters for API limits
- Blob-based audio URL generation for playback

**Voice Input**: Web Speech API integration
- Browser-native speech recognition
- Voice command processing
- Real-time transcription for chat input

**Advanced Audio Processing**:
- Custom AudioWorklet processor for low-latency analysis
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for frequency analysis
- RMS (Root Mean Square) volume calculation
- Pitch detection algorithms
- Real-time audio feature extraction (frequency, waveform, tempo, key)
- Audio effects chain (reverb, delay, distortion, filters, compression)
- Visualization modes (spectrum, waveform)

### Data Storage

**Browser Storage Strategy**:
- localStorage for persistent user preferences and settings
- sessionStorage for temporary session data
- Zustand persist middleware for automatic state synchronization
- Session management with save/load capabilities
- Chat history persistence across page refreshes

**State Schema**:
```javascript
{
  user: string,
  messages: array<{id, from, msg, time, type}>,
  ui: {theme, gradientShift, sliderValue, patternDepth},
  audio: {playing, volume, isListening, audioUrl},
  sceneConfig: {particleCount, rotation, color},
  analytics: {messageCount, responseTime, sessionStart}
}
```

### Brand Integration System

**Asset Management**: Organized PNG-based brand system
- Centralized configuration in `src/config/brandConfig.js`
- Nine brand assets organized in `/public/brand/` directory
- BeyMedia logo as primary watermark element
- Ultra-subtle opacity levels (2-8%) for non-intrusive branding
- Audio-reactive animations synchronized with voice interactions
- Multiple integration points: watermarks, floating elements, chat accents, particles, sidebar

**Visual Integration Strategy**:
- Background patterns with 30-second alternation
- Center-positioned watermark with 4% opacity
- Floating brand elements with gentle dopaminergic animations
- Particle effects using brand assets
- Blend modes (overlay) for seamless integration
- Scale differentiation (BeyMedia logo 1.1x larger)

### Performance Optimization

**Build Optimization**:
- Vite's esbuild for fast bundling
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- Asset optimization and compression

**Runtime Performance**:
- Event debouncing for expensive operations
- Animation frame throttling for 3D rendering
- Efficient store subscriptions with selectors
- Memoization of expensive computations
- Lazy loading of heavy modules

**Analytics & Monitoring**:
- Custom analytics engine tracking user interactions
- Real-time metrics (active users, messages per minute, response time, error rate)
- Session tracking with unique IDs
- Performance metrics collection (viewport, user agent, timing data)
- Event buffering (last 1000 events in memory)

### Modular Architecture

**Component Organization**:
- `/src/components/` - Reusable UI components (BrandAssets, AudioComponents, DopamineUI)
- `/src/modules/` - Feature modules (ChatPanel, Visualizer3D, AIStudio, SessionManager)
- `/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (useAdvancedAudio, useAnalytics, useKeyboardShortcuts, useWebhook, useWeb3)
- `/src/store/` - State management with multiple specialized stores
- `/src/automation/` - Banana Flow automation system
- `/src/config/` - Configuration files (brand assets, API endpoints)
- `/src/utils/` - Utility functions (patterns, gradients, particles, color interpolation)

**Extension Points**:
- Web3 wallet integration hooks (placeholder for MetaMask/WalletConnect)
- 3D avatar identity system (placeholder for blockchain-based avatars)
- Plugin architecture for custom flows in Banana Flow
- Dynamic route registration for runtime automation flows
